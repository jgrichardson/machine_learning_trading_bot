# Machine Learning Trading Bot

This application is an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets. Specifically. this application:

* Implements an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate trade decisions.

* Adjusts input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.

* Trains a new machine learning model and compares its performance to that of a baseline model.

This application also includes a report below that compares the performance of the machine learning models based on the trading predictions that each makes and the resulting cumulative strategy returns.

## Report

### Conclusions About Performance of the Baseline Trading Algorithm

Cumulative return plot that shows the actual returns vs. the strategy returns.

INSERT BASELINE PLOT AS A PNG HERE



### Results from Changing the Training Window Timeframe

What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?




### Results from Changing the SMA Windows

What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?




### Results from Using a New Machine Learning Classifier (adaBoost)


INSERT HERE -- PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns for this updated trading algorithm

Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? 


Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?

### Summary Evaluation Report

INSERT HERE = Final conclusions and analysis. Findings supported by using the PNG images that were created.
